# snake_game
The classic snake arcade game.

I still have a lot of bugs to sort out and fix:

	There seems to be performance issues when playing the game and not giving the program input - the snake starts jumping across the screen.
	
	The high scores system needs to be implemented properly.
	
	A proper window should be defined when playing the game.
	
	The snake can sometimes run into itself without the game failing.
	
	The game doesn't seem to end anymore when the snake runs into a wall.
